# Summary Report: AWS Vietnam Community Day & First Cloud Journey 2026

### Event Objectives
- Share in-depth knowledge on applying Generative AI (GenAI), fine-tuning, and building Multi-Agent systems.
- Provide methods to optimize the AI user experience through Context building and Memory integration.
- Guide the construction of a secure, cost-optimized, and highly performant cloud platform architecture using Amazon CloudFront.
- Inspire attendees through real-world product development journeys in Hackathon competitions.

### Speakers
- **Tinh Truong** – Platform Engineer, GoTymeX
- **Anh Pham** – Cloud Consultant, G-AsiaPacific Vietnam & AWS Community Builder
- **Thuan Nguyen** – DevOps Engineer, First Cloud AI Journey
- **Thao Nguyen & Mai Nguyen & Uyen Le** - GenAI Engineer, VIB
- **Duc Dao** – Solution Architect, Cloud Kinetics
- **Vy Lam** – Senior Business Systems Analyst, VPBank

### Key Highlights

#### 1. Context Is Everything: Making AI Actually Work for You (Tinh Truong)
![Session 1](/images/4-Event/event_1/session1.jpg)
- **Common Mistakes:** AI giving poor answers is often due to weak input (context) rather than the model itself. Cramming too much garbage information (Internet Puller) reduces accuracy and wastes tokens.
- **Context Building Formula:** A good context needs 4 essential elements: Goal, Relevant info, Constraints, and Success criteria.
- **The Evolution of AI:** How we interact with AI is shifting from simply using Prompts -> Building Context -> Forming Memory (A second AI brain) to support long-term personalization.

#### 2. Friendly AI Assistant with Amazon Q (Anh Pham)
![Session 2](/images/4-Event/event_1/session2.jpg)
- **Q Chat Agent:** AI assistants for exploring data, analyzing insights, and automating PM tasks like summarizing meeting minutes, sending emails, and scheduling.
- **Q Flows:** Create intelligent workflows with natural language — no coding required.
- **Q Spaces & Sight:** Shared collaborative spaces that turn individual insights into team knowledge, and build dashboards/reports from raw data using natural language.

#### 3. From Edge To Origin: CloudFront as Your Foundation (Thuan Nguyen)
![Session 3](/images/4-Event/event_1/session3.jpg)
- **Cost and Security Issues:** The pay-as-you-go model can sometimes result in unexpected CDN bills. Routing and protection packages are needed to mitigate financial risks.
- **Origin Cloaking:** Utilizing Origin Access Control (OAC) to lock direct access to S3 and Lambda ensures that traffic must route through CloudFront.
- **High Availability:** CloudFront supports Failover configuration when the primary origin fails, maintaining an uninterrupted user experience and boosting speed with HTTP Compression (reducing load times by up to 81%).

#### 4. 36 hrs with LotusHacks – Building UTMorpho from Idea to Reality (Thao Nguyen & Mai Nguyen & Uyen Le)
![Session 4](/images/4-Event/event_1/session4.jpg)
- **From Zero to Idea:** The brainstorming journey of defining the problem and shaping UTMorpho.
- **Building Under Pressure:** A 36-hour development sprint facing challenges, failures, and turning points.
- **Key Learnings:** The best ideas stem from real-world frustrations. In teamwork, synchronization is paramount, and one must avoid "scope creep" (overloading features).

#### 5. Non-Determinism of "Deterministic" LLM Settings (Duc Dao)
- **The Reality of Temperature = 0:** Theoretically, Temp=0 should yield deterministic results (100% identical outputs). In reality, however, no LLM guarantees consistency across all tasks.
- **Technical Causes:** GPU architectures perform floating-point operations that lack associativity, and API providers often batch user requests to optimize costs, leading to minor errors that alter the final output.
- **Mitigation Strategies:** Build systems with an "accept variability" mindset using majority voting (running multiple times and picking the most common result), enforcing output types (JSON, YAML), and using temp=0.1 to prevent the model from getting stuck in repetitive loops.

#### 6. Enterprise-Grade Multi-Agent System: The Case of Startup Credit Scoring (Vy Lam)
![Session 6](/images/4-Event/event_1/session6.jpg)
- **Limitations of a Single Agent:** Using a single AI Agent for credit approvals often encounters context limits, diluted expertise, a lack of cross-checking, and becoming a single point of failure.
- **The Power of Multi-Agent:** An architecture simulating a virtual credit committee comprised of specialized Agents (Financial Analysis, Market, Team, Risk, and Compliance) helps make more accurate decisions.
- **Enterprise-Grade Mindset:** To transition from POC to Production, the system must be equipped with Guardrails (input/output protection), security (MFA, encryption), Data Governance (handling PII), and compliance with frameworks like SOC 2 and GDPR.

### Key Takeaways

#### On AI Mindset & App Development
- **Quality over Quantity:** Provide high-quality Context for AI instead of a pile of garbage data.
- **Multi-Agent Mechanisms:** Complex enterprise problems should be broken down and cross-processed by multiple AI Agents instead of relying on a single agent.
- **Understanding Technology Basics:** Do not blindly trust the deterministic setting (temperature=0) of LLMs for high-risk applications.

#### Technical Architecture
- Secure the system from the network edge to the origin server using CloudFront and Guardrails.
- Transition from manual processes to integrating AI Agents and "Second Brain" systems with memory retrieval capabilities.

### Applying to Work
- **Optimize internal LLM systems:** Shift mindset when writing Prompts, utilize the 4-step framework (Goal, Info, Constraints, Criteria), and experiment with temp=0.1 if repetitive responses occur.
- **Experiment with Multi-Agent Architectures:** Build automated evaluation workflows instead of using one long, single prompt.
- **CDN Security:** Re-evaluate access permissions (bucket policies) on AWS S3, and implement OAC instead of the legacy OAI to enhance static content security.

### Event Experience
Attending the AWS Vietnam Community Day 2026 provided me with an incredibly realistic perspective on the challenges of deploying AI in an Enterprise environment. From deep technical issues like GPU floating-point errors skewing LLMs, to designing a multi-layered security architecture with Multi-Agent and CloudFront.

The event didn't just impart technical knowledge but also reminded me of product-thinking: Always start from a real "pain point", maintain focus, and establish guardrails before scaling. The biggest highlight was realizing that the boundary between "knowing how to use AI" and "making AI work effectively" lies entirely in our ability to provide and manage Context.
